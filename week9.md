For this week we used sonicvisualiser to show more data of our chosen pieces. I chose the same three pieces I analysed back in week 8. We downloaded the music into sonic visualiser where we created a Spectrogram, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and a Chromgram. We were shown how to change the colours to beter read the visuals however I stuck to the standard settings as it was easier to read for me. We were then asked to analyse our shown data in reference to the music chosen.
