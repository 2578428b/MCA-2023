# week 9

[week 1](week1.md)  [week 2](week2.md)  [week 3](week3.md)  [week 4](week4.md)  [week 5](week5.md)   [week7](week7.md)  [week 8](week8.md)  [week 9](week9.md)  [week 10](week10.md)  

For this week we used sonicvisualiser to show more data of our chosen pieces. I chose the same three pieces I analysed back in week 8. We downloaded the music into sonic visualiser where we created a Spectrogram, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and a Chromgram. We were shown how to change the colours to beter read the visuals however I stuck to the standard settings as it was easier to read for me. We were then asked to analyse our shown data in reference to the music chosen. 

Requiem:

*Analysis*
It is very interessting looking at the pieces this way and evaluating their data in these forms. We can tell from the coeficiants mainly but also from looking at the spectrogram that the Requiem and Symphony pieces uses very similar instruments as they are very dense colour wise, whereas the Fantasia piece, since it is one solo instrument is a lot less dense. The Requiem piece frequency wise is both very high and very low but not many middle frequencies are heard or seen, whereas the Symphony frequencies are mainly middle with a few featred high frequencies and very little low frequencies. This is much harder to see for the Fantasia piece since again its olnly one instrument which has both high and low frequencies but not as prominent as a symphony orchestra does.
