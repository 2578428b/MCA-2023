*The first week was about to present music data, the negatives and positives as well as exactly how the data is described* 

3 Types of music data

•	Spectrogram
- stored as a graph 
- contains pitch and sound levels
- it is colour coded like weather on a map but doesn’t allow someone to completely replicate what its displaying  
- data is described by colours, usually displayed on a key by the side
  
•	Notation
- shown almost as a graph
- you have to be knowledgeable about music, musical notes and muscical sayings to know how to read and write music notation
- data is described by notes that correlate to notes on an instrument such as voice, piano. Each note on the stave correlates and exact note on the chosen instrument
  
•Music metadata eg artist name song name date of release
- shown as names and dates on either pages like spotify or wikipedia
- nothing overly complicated about this type of data, easy to read and obtain from multiple platforms, you dont need any skills to read this sort of data
- data is raw and unchanged
