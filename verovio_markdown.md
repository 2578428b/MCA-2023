# My findings

When converting the piece info the MEI file, it was interessting what codes were being used to display the informartion of specific notes, for example "dur=" meant the duration of the note aqnd "pname=" meant the exact name of the notes. These were relativly simple to understand and changing them created an obvious change to the notation of the piece. However, there were a few codes such as "dur=ppq" which after a while we realised meant the duriation of the notes per 1/4, which when changed does not create an obvious change to the notation of the music like the others. It was interessting that every single piece of infomation such as stacattos and dynamics had an entire line of code. This sort of code would be easier to read by someone who is more experienced with coding rather than notation, however theres no obvious code for the types of instruments, key signature and time signature which is more obvious on a piece of notation. As well unless the dynamics are notated on the piece, whilst rhythm is displayed with the duration of the note, the pitch is not.
