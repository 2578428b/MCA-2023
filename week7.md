This week was all about copyright. We were asked to add a copyright claim and explain our reasoning as well as state the metadate we chose to add to our verovio piece and why. I decided to choose the [Creative Commons CC0 1.0](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/) as I own very little of the work done to my piece of music. I have only edited a very small proportion of the program data and did not write, producde or play the piece so I feel it is only fair to allow the public domain to be able to add and change my work to suit  their needs as I feel it wont be ethical for my to take advantage of someone elses work when I did so little to add to the piece as a whole.
