This week we were asked to choose 3 pieces which related to our musical theme, mine was Mozart so I decided to choose 3 of his pieces. We then had to analyse the pieces and create a table displaying the most important non-technical metadata for each individual piece, The list of information we had to find were:
- Title
- Artist
- Composer
- Copyright information
- Genre
- Source
- File/audio format
- Number of channels
- Sample rate
- Bits per second
- Duration

We had to add our pieces into Sonic Visualiser to find some information such as 'Number of Channels' and 'Sample rate'. The information is listed below as well as a link to each song I chose from YouTube.
