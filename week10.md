*The final weeks task was about transcriptions, siminlarly to preivous weeks, we had to create a transcription through musescore as well as Chroma features through SonicVisualiser*. 

For my pieces I used the same three pieces of *Fantasia*, *Symphony* and *Requiem*. As we can see all three pieces are Classical music pieces, however this is a broad genre as it just classes music mainly by the era they were released and not actually by stylistc features which most modern pieces do today, however we can easily see *Requiem* is most similar in genre to *Symphony* than *Fantasia* is to either of these pieces.

For the second task of the transcription of our piece from week 2, listening to the transcription, Musescore once again overall manadged to have the piece almost exact. You can tell its the same piece being played with just a few mistakes, these mistakes come from more detail into the piece such as the time signature and musical details such as gracenotes, rest lengths and slurs. These, whilst arent incerdibly important, do have significant value to the piece as Mozart was known for his eye to detail in his pieces. As well, it has messed up which stave certain notes should be, chaning some which are lower in the trebel clef to be sitting higher on the bass clef. Another detail it messd up was the accuracy of where some notes actually sit in the music and when theys should be played in relation to the other notes around them as some notes in the trebel clef have been changed to either be played before the notes in the bass clef and vice verse, which throws off the timing of the piece in the bars where this occurs.
